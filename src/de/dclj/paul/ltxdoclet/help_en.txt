LaTeX doclet options:
=====================

Output options:
---------------

 -d 〈dir〉           Directory in which to put the generated .tex files.
 -docencoding 〈enc〉 Name of the encoding of the LaTeX files. Default is the
                    default encoding of the system (now {0}).
 -doctitle 〈title〉  Document title.

Link options:
-------------

 All the link options are of the form
   -link[offline][end|footnote][html|pdf] (〈url〉|〈pdf-url〉)
       [〈package-list-url〉|〈idx-url〉] [〈linktitle〉]
 where the actual option defines which options are needed/available.

* 'html' (or nothing) means creating links to an HTML documentation.
   Needs 〈url〉.
* 'pdf' means creating links to a PDF created with this doclet.
   Needs 〈pdf-url〉.

* 'offline' means to look for the package list not at the link URL,
   but somewhere else. Needs 〈package-list-url〉.

* 'end' means to put the links at the end of the file in a link section
   instead of inline. Needs 〈linktitle〉. In the PDF-case, needs 〈idx-url〉,
   too.
* 'footnotes' means to put the links in footnotes at the bottom of each
   page, instead of inline. Needs  〈linktitle〉. In the PDF-case, needs
   〈idx-url〉, too.
* (none of these) means to put the links inline.

(I think some of these are not yet implemented.)


 -linkhtml 〈url〉    Create external links to a javadoc HTML documentation.
 -link 〈url〉        Synonymous to -linkhtml
 -linkfootnotehtml 〈url〉 〈linktitle〉
                    Create external links to a javadoc HTML documentation

 -linkendhtml 〈url〉 〈linktitle〉

                    reference.
 -linkofflinehtml 〈url〉 〈package-list-url〉
                    Like -linkhtml, but look for the package list at
                    〈package-list-url〉 instead of 〈url〉.
 -linkoffline 〈url〉 〈package-list-url〉
                    Synonymous to -linkofflinehtml
 -linkofflinefootnotehtml 〈url〉 〈package-list-url〉
                    wie -linkfootnotehtml, aber sucht die
                    Package-Liste nicht bei 〈url〉, sondern bei
                    〈package-list-url〉.
 -linkofflineendhtml 〈url〉 〈package-list-url〉 〈linktitle〉
                    wie -linkendhtml,  but look for the package list at

 -linkpdf 〈pdf-url〉 Creates links to another PDF file (should be created with
                    this doclet). The package-list will be searched in the
                    same directory.
 -linkofflinepdf 〈pdf-url〉 〈pkglst-url〉
                    Creates links to another PDF file (should be created with

                    〈pkglst-url〉.
 -linkfootnotepdf 〈pdf-url〉 〈idx-url〉 〈linktitle〉
                    Creates links to another PDF file (should be created with
                    this doclet), in the form of footnotes. 〈idx-url〉 is a
                    LaTeX .idx file used to get the page numbers, 
                    〈linktitle〉 will be used for as the reference title.
 -linkendpdf 〈pdf-url〉 〈idx-url〉 〈linktitle〉
                    Creates links to another PDF file (should be created with
                    this doclet), at the end of the file. 〈idx-url〉 is a
                    LaTeX .idx file used to get the page numbers, 
                    〈linktitle〉 will be used for as the reference title.

Source options:
---------------

 -includesource     Add source code to the created documentation. We
                    only add source code for documented elements, so
                    make sure to also add -private if you want the complete
                    source code.
 -classpath 〈path〉  The classpath for the embedded compiler call. (This is
                    a javadoc option which we are reusing.)
 -sourcepath 〈path〉 The classpath for the embedded compiler call. (This is
                     a javadoc option which we are reusing.)
 -encoding 〈path〉   The source encoding for the embedded compiler call.
                    (This is a javadoc option which we are reusing.)
 -source 〈version〉  The Java version of the source code. (This is
                    a javadoc option which we are reusing.)
